# Plan: Get tui-integration-design onto upstream v1.5/main

This branch includes the web app, shared project, TUI, and reworked CLI using shared. Client/server apps will be removed (or are not needed from main). The goal is for **all branch changes to win**; conflicts against main have already been resolved recently, so conflicts with v1.5 should be minimal.

## Steps

1. **Rebase onto v1.5/main**
   - `git fetch upstream`
   - `git rebase upstream/v1.5/main`

2. **Resolve any conflicts by keeping this branch’s version**
   - For every conflict, keep the branch version (shared, TUI, reworked CLI, web app, and client/server removal).
   - During a rebase, “your” content is in the commit being replayed (“theirs” in rebase terminology), so when resolving, keep that side.

3. **Push and open the PR**
   - `git push origin tui-integration-design --force-with-lease`
   - Open PR: base = **modelcontextprotocol/inspector** branch **v1.5/main**, compare = **BobDickinson/inspector** branch **tui-integration-design**.

## Notes

- Deleting client/server before the rebase is optional; it only affects how the history looks, not the outcome.
- No need to merge main’s changes into this branch—the rebase replays this branch on top of v1.5/main so the PR is a linear “v1.5/main + these commits.”
