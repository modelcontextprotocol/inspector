# Plan: Get tui-integration-design onto upstream v1.5/main

This branch includes the web app, **core** (renamed from shared), TUI, and reworked CLI using core. Client/server have been removed. The goal is for **all branch changes to win**; conflicts against main have already been resolved recently, so conflicts with v1.5 should be minimal.

## Steps

1. **Rebase onto v1.5/main**
   - **`git fetch upstream`** — Downloads the latest commits from the `upstream` remote (modelcontextprotocol/inspector) into your local repo. It does **not** change your current branch or working tree; it only updates your local copy of branches like `upstream/v1.5/main`.
   - **`git rebase upstream/v1.5/main`** — Replays your branch’s commits on top of `upstream/v1.5/main`. Git temporarily moves your branch pointer to the tip of v1.5/main, then applies each of your commits one by one. If a commit applies cleanly, it’s replayed; if it conflicts, rebase stops and waits for you to fix conflicts (see step 2) and run `git rebase --continue` (or `git rebase --abort` to cancel).
   - **If you hit a bunch of conflicts and want to undo:** Run **`git rebase --abort`**. That cancels the rebase and restores your branch and working tree to exactly how they were right before you ran `git rebase`. You can then fix things or try again later.

2. **If the rebase stops with conflicts, resolve them (keep this branch’s content)**
   - When rebase hits a conflict, Git will print something like `CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in <file>` and stop.
   - In rebase, **“theirs” = the commit being replayed (your branch)** and **“ours” = the branch you rebased onto (v1.5/main)**. So to keep your version, keep “theirs.”
   - For each conflicted file, either:
     - **Option A:** `git checkout --theirs -- <path>` then `git add <path>`, or
     - **Option B:** Open the file, delete the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`), leave the code that came from **your** branch (the block after `=======` that was “theirs”), save, then `git add <path>`.
   - After all conflicts in that commit are fixed: `git add` any resolved files, then `git rebase --continue`.
   - If it stops again on a later commit, repeat: resolve (keep your branch’s version), `git add`, `git rebase --continue`.
   - To abort and go back to before the rebase: `git rebase --abort`.

3. **Push and open the PR**
   - `git push origin tui-integration-design --force-with-lease`
   - Open PR: base = **modelcontextprotocol/inspector** branch **v1.5/main**, compare = **BobDickinson/inspector** branch **tui-integration-design**.

## Notes

- No need to merge main’s changes into this branch—the rebase replays this branch on top of v1.5/main so the PR is a linear “v1.5/main + these commits.”
