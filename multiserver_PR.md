# Multi-Server Support for MCP Inspector

## Overview

This pull request introduces comprehensive multi-server support to the MCP Inspector, transforming it from a single-server debugging tool into a powerful multi-server management platform. This enhancement addresses the growing need for developers to work with multiple MCP servers simultaneously while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing workflows.

## Problem Statement

The original MCP Inspector was designed to work with a single MCP server at a time, which created several limitations for developers:

1. **Context Switching Overhead**: Developers working with multiple MCP servers had to manually reconfigure and restart the inspector for each server, breaking their workflow
2. **No Comparative Analysis**: Unable to compare capabilities, resources, or tools across different servers in a unified interface
3. **Limited Scalability**: As MCP ecosystems grow, developers need to manage increasingly complex server configurations
4. **Isolated Debugging**: Each server had to be debugged in isolation, making it difficult to understand interactions between servers
5. **Configuration Management**: No centralized way to manage multiple server configurations and their connection states

## Solution Overview

We implemented a comprehensive multi-server architecture that extends the MCP Inspector with:

### üèóÔ∏è **Server-Side Architecture**
- **Multi-Server API**: RESTful endpoints for server management, connection control, and MCP request proxying
- **Real-Time Event Streaming**: Server-Sent Events for live status updates and notifications across all servers
- **Connection Management**: Independent connection lifecycle management for each server
- **Centralized Logging**: Synchronized logging level management across all connected servers
- **Transport Flexibility**: Support for both STDIO and HTTP transport types in multi-server configurations

### üé® **Client-Side Interface**
- **Unified Dashboard**: Tabbed interface for managing multiple servers with real-time status monitoring
- **Server Management**: Complete CRUD operations for server configurations with validation
- **Error Aggregation**: Sophisticated error handling with console error interception and deduplication
- **State Persistence**: LocalStorage-based configuration management with cache invalidation
- **Mode Switching**: Seamless toggle between single-server and multi-server modes

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation (`server/src/multiserver/`)

The server-side implementation follows a modular architecture:

```
server/src/multiserver/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/                 # Type definitions and data models
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/              # Business logic services
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/                 # Utility functions and helpers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ middleware/            # Express middleware
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ routes/               # REST API endpoints
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ __tests__/           # Comprehensive test suite
```

**Key Components:**

- **ServerManager**: Handles CRUD operations for server configurations with Zod validation
- **ConnectionManager**: Manages connection lifecycle, status tracking, and transport creation
- **EventStreamService**: Provides real-time updates via Server-Sent Events
- **MCP Proxy**: Unified API for communicating with individual servers without direct client connections

For detailed technical documentation, see [`server/src/multiserver/README.md`](server/src/multiserver/README.md).

### Frontend Implementation (`client/src/components/multiserver/`)

The client-side implementation provides a rich, interactive interface:

```
client/src/components/multiserver/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/                # Custom React hooks for state management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/            # API communication layer
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ stores/              # Centralized data stores
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/               # TypeScript definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/               # Utility functions and helpers
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [React Components]   # UI components
```

**Key Features:**

- **useMultiServer Hook**: 600+ lines of comprehensive state management with real-time updates
- **Error Management**: Sophisticated error aggregation with console interception
- **Request Optimization**: Deduplication and batching for improved performance
- **History Management**: Centralized notification and interaction tracking

For detailed technical documentation, see [`client/src/components/multiserver/README.md`](client/src/components/multiserver/README.md).
