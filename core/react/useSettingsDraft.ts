/**
 * Draft state for the per-server "settings" modal.
 *
 * `ServerSettingsModal` is a fully controlled component: every input
 * change fires back up to the parent, which must re-render with the new
 * value or the input's `value` prop goes stale and characters appear to
 * be eaten. We can't drive that re-render from the server-list state
 * alone — the PUT round-trip is too slow for per-keystroke updates, and
 * background refreshes of the server list would clobber in-progress
 * edits.
 *
 * This hook holds the draft locally, debounces the PUT, and exposes a
 * synchronous `flush` for the caller to invoke on modal close so the
 * final keystrokes always land. Extracted out of `App.tsx` so the
 * behavior is unit-testable in isolation (the App.tsx wiring is hard
 * to drive from a React Testing Library harness because of its many
 * Mantine + state-manager dependencies).
 *
 * Initialization is `targetId`-keyed by design: the draft only resets
 * when the modal opens to a *different* server, not on every change to
 * the underlying entry. That's what lets a background refresh of the
 * server list run without losing the user's in-progress edits.
